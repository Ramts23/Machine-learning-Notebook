# Machine Learning Note

# Introduction:

**What is machine learning?**

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that gives computer systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

**AI vs ML vs DL:**

- AI: Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of creating machines or systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
- ML: Machine learning is a method of achieving AI where systems learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.
- DL: Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to automatically learn complex patterns from large amounts of data.
